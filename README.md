# BitBurner
Scripts for BitBurner, not all are mine, but youâ€™re welcome to use whatever you like!

For those looking for the [AugFinder](https://github.com/TheeWingman/BitBurner/blob/b4487d07deda7716e605b5a30ac07d9f44898179/AugFinder/aFInstaller.js), you can click the hyperlink above and copy and paste the installer to your main directory, it will create the proper subdirectory and create an alias "aF" for AugFinder.
